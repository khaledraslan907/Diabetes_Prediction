# Diabetes_Prediction
# Classification Model by Support Vector Machine
# Project Overview:
# 1- Loading the Dataset:
The dataset is loaded using the pandas library, providing a structured way to manage and analyze the data.
# 2- Exploring and Describing the Data:
Several methods are employed to understand the dataset better:
head(): Displays the first few rows of the dataset.
shape: Shows the dimensions of the dataset.
describe(): Provides a statistical summary of the dataset.
value_counts(): Counts the occurrences of different values in a column.
groupby(): Groups data by a particular column and performs aggregate functions.
# 3- Standardizing the Data:
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. This step is crucial for evaluating the performance of the model on unseen data.
# 4- Splitting the Data:
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function. This step is crucial for evaluating the performance of the model on unseen data.
# 5- Building and Training the SVM Model:
The Support Vector Machine algorithm is used to create a classification model. The model is trained on the training set and its performance is evaluated on the test set.
# 6- Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is assessed using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of the model in predicting diabetes.
